## Summary 

One drawback from this webpage is that it doesn't work if even one input is incorrectly input, so it is needed to have all the information as to know what can work.

One recommendation would be to accept in the inputs the most common variations of the inputs as to permit working with those.

Another would be the modification of the layout just for visual purposes so it doesn't look like a 1995 webpage filled of conspiracy theories, but rather help inform.
